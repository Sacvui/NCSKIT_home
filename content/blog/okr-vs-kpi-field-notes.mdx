## Divergence between KPIs and OKRs

- **KPIs** answer *“Are we running at a healthy cadence?”* — daily/weekly guardrails.  
- **OKRs** answer *“Are we bending the research trajectory?”* — quarterly bets tied to journals, grants, or policy impact.

When we mapped 14 Vietnamese research teams, the average **Objective** came from dean-level mandates (e.g., “Publish Scopus Q2 paper on green finance”), while the **Key Results** were derived from the *Zero-to-Hero* automation phases.

### Minimal math model

$$
\text{Output Quality} = \gamma \times \text{OKR Alignment} + (1 - \gamma) \times \text{KPI Health}
$$

`γ` drifts between 0.55 and 0.75 depending on funding cycles. During peak submission season we bias governance rituals toward OKR workshops; during off-season we revert to KPI hygiene (data labeling accuracy, reviewer turnaround time).

## Rituals inside ncskit.org

1. **Monday Metric Review** – pull LangSmith traces to detect broken prompts.  
2. **Wednesday Playbook Audit** – marketing/knowledge teams rewrite the Knowledge Atlas entries if hypotheses changed.  
3. **Friday Lab Demo** – cross-functional review of R/Python notebooks, verifying `project_config.json` integrity.

## Tool Stack

- Linear for macro OKRs (2 per quarter).  
- ClickUp dashboards mirrored from our `workflow.steps`.  
- Notion-style doc stored in MDX so we can version-control Vietnamese ↔ English without a CMS.

> Every post is treated like a mini research artifact: prompt history, dataset hashes, and reviewer notes travel with the MDX file so compliance teams can audit swiftly.

The payoff: governance narratives feel editorial (thanks to Tailwind Typography) but remain machine-auditable for grants, institutional review boards, and Nvivo-style coding.
