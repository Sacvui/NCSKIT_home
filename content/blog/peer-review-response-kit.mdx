## Anatomy of a great response

1. **Gratitude** – acknowledge the reviewer ID and summarize the main concern.  
2. **Evidence** – cite the exact section/line where the revision lives.  
3. **Clarification** – explain the statistical or theoretical logic with math if needed.  
4. **Tone control** – bilingual phrasing ensures the Vietnamese PDF mirrors the English submission.

### Math-friendly rebuttal

If Reviewer #2 questions the robustness of the regression, restate the equation:

$$
\hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \varepsilon
$$

Then note the change: “We now report Adjusted \\( R^2 = 0.67 \\) in Table 4 and include heteroskedasticity tests.”

## Template snippet (MDX)

```md
> **Reviewer 2, Comment 1**  
> Please justify the selection of Likert scale anchors.

**Response**  
We expanded Section 3.1 to detail the five-point semantic differential scale...
```

## Automation hooks

- The Knowledge Atlas stores canned responses for common reviewer archetypes.  
- `remark-math` lets us inline derivations without exporting images.  
- `rehype-katex` ensures the exported static HTML on Vercel is still production-grade.

Outcome: a repeatable, SEO-friendly longform article that still meets journal submission etiquette.
