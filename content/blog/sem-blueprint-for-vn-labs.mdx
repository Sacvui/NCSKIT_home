## Phase 0 → Phase 5 mapping

| Phase | Output | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 | Topic shortlist + theory graph | Ideation Wizard |
| Phase 1 | Draw.io XML + hypothesis list | Draw.io bi-directional sync |
| Phase 2 | `sections/01` + `sections/02` | Semantic Scholar agent |
| Phase 3 | `sections/03` + `sections/04` | R/Python notebooks + LangSmith |
| Phase 4 | Reviewer-ready discussion | Obsidian vault |
| Phase 5 | Word/PDF export | ncskit.org Release CLI |

### Measurement model sanity check

1. Cronbach’s Alpha threshold ≥ 0.7 before EFA.  
2. EFA factor loadings > 0.5 retained; we log rejects into `project_config.json` for transparency.  
3. CFA is run with a bilingual template so committees can review both Vietnamese + English definitions.

### Structural model snippet

```python
# /notebooks/sem_pipeline.py
paths = sem.estimate(model, data=df_clean)
paths.filter(lambda p: p.p_value < 0.05).plot()
```

And yes, every coefficient is mirrored inside the MDX article using math notation:

$$
\text{Intention} = 0.62 \times \text{Perceived Usefulness} + 0.28 \times \text{Trust} - 0.11 \times \text{Perceived Risk}
$$

## Reviewer checklist

- Export standardized loadings and AVE stats into `resources/sem-audit.xlsx`.  
- Provide `schema-dts` metadata so Google Scholar understands the article hierarchy.  
- Link back to the Knowledge Atlas entry (`/knowledge-atlas/sem`) to keep UX consistent.

With Tailwind Typography we can mix Vietnamese storytelling, math-heavy derivations, and CTA blocks without fighting inline styles—a single `.prose` class keeps everything clean for desktop and mobile.
