## Introduction

Data speaks louder than words. In this article, we analyze the growth of "Open Science" publications and the impact of AI on research methodologies using interactive visualizations.

## The Rise of Open Science

Over the past 5 years, the number of journals adopting Open Access policies has skyrocketed.

## AI Adoption in Methodologies

We surveyed 500 researchers about their use of AI tools. The results show a clear shift towards automated literature review and data analysis.

## Conclusion

The trends are clear: research is becoming more open and more automated. Embracing these tools is no longer optional but essential for staying competitive.
