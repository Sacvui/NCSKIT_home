# Writing for NCSKIT

The NCSKIT blog is built on **MDX**, allowing us to write content in Markdown while embedding React components. This guide explains how to add new posts and manage the content structure.

## 1. Adding a New Post

To create a new article, simply add a `.mdx` file to the `content/blog` directory. The filename will become the URL slug (e.g., `my-new-post.mdx` becomes `/blog/my-new-post`).

### Frontmatter

Every post must start with a YAML frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
date: "2025-11-26"
summary: "A short description that appears in the blog index and SEO meta tags."
category: "blog-writing"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
readingTime: "5 min read"
---
```

### Categories

The `category` field must match one of the `anchor` IDs defined in `lib/content.ts`. Common categories include:

- `blog-marketing`: Marketing & Những Cú Lừa
- `blog-management`: Quản Trị & Drama Công Sở
- `blog-economics`: Kinh Tế Vỉa Hè
- `blog-lab`: Phòng Lab "Chạy Số"
- `blog-writing`: Bút Chiến Học Thuật
- `blog-vault`: Kho "Đồ Chơi" nghiên cứu

## 2. Using MDX Components

You can use standard Markdown syntax for headers, lists, and links. Additionally, you can use React components if they are imported or globally available.

### Math Equations

We support LaTeX math equations using `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## 3. Images

Place images in the `public/images/blog` directory and reference them using standard Markdown image syntax or the Next.js `<Image />` component.

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/blog/my-image.png)
```

## 4. Best Practices

- **Bilingual Support**: Currently, posts are written primarily in Vietnamese or English. Ensure the tone matches the target audience (e.g., "Street Economics" uses a more casual, witty tone).
- **SEO**: Always include a compelling `summary` and relevant `tags`.
- **Structure**: Use H2 (`##`) and H3 (`###`) for clear hierarchy.

Happy writing!
