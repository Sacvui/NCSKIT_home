## Introduction

"Is my sample size large enough?" This is perhaps the most common question asked by graduate students. The answer, unfortunately, is rarely a simple number. It depends on the complexity of your model, the strength of the relationships, and the statistical power you wish to achieve.

## The Science of Sample Size

### Power Analysis

Statistical power is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. A study with low power may fail to detect true effects.
*   **G*Power** has been the standard tool, but modern platforms like NCSKIT integrate power analysis directly into the model building process, suggesting the required sample size based on your specific SEM structure.

### The "10 Times Rule"

A common rule of thumb in SEM is to have 10 times as many observations as the number of indicators. However, this is often an oversimplification. Monte Carlo simulations provide a much more accurate estimation.

## Reliability and Validity

Collecting data is not enough; you must prove it is trustworthy.

### Cronbach's Alpha vs. Composite Reliability (CR)

While Cronbach's Alpha is widely used, it assumes equal factor loadings—an assumption often violated. **Composite Reliability (CR)** is a more robust measure for SEM.
$$
CR = \frac{(\sum \lambda_i)^2}{(\sum \lambda_i)^2 + \sum Var(\epsilon_i)}
$$

### Average Variance Extracted (AVE)

AVE measures the amount of variance captured by a construct versus the amount due to measurement error. An AVE > 0.5 is generally required for convergent validity.

## Automated Validation with NCSKIT

Calculating CR and AVE manually is tedious. NCSKIT computes these metrics automatically for every latent variable in your model, flagging any constructs that fail to meet the thresholds (e.g., CR < 0.7 or AVE < 0.5).

## Conclusion

Statistical rigor is non-negotiable in high-impact publishing. By understanding and correctly applying sample size and reliability criteria, you build a solid foundation for your research findings.
